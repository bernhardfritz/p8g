# line

## Description

Draws a line (a direct path between two points) to the screen. Lines are drawn with a default width of 1 pixel. This width can be modified by using the [strokeWeight](strokeWeight) function. A line cannot be filled, therefore the [fill](fill) function will not affect the color of a line. So to color a line, use the [stroke](stroke) function.

## Syntax

```c
line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
```
